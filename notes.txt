first, I need to run the default test and save the output

I'm expecting an array of SpecResults that I can easily save as a json file.
if that is the case then I can use the json and some npm tool to test the frontend

how to indicate in json whether a test session is for a ticket or for a safety check or for something else. leave extendability open

TestSession {
    "repo": optional string
    "issue": optional number
    "npi": optional string (for safety check)
    "timestamp": Date
    "results": Array<Result>
    "test-link": link to code on github?
    "plan-link": link to issue being tested on github or to safety check being performed
}

tests = map[number]TestSession

key = fnv(repo + issue + npi + timestamp)

i think ultimately we want to store our test sessions in a sql database because
we want to be able to search by different parameters such as by repo + issue or by npi or by time
